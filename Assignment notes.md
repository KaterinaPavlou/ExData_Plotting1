## Exploratory Data Analysis - Assignment 1 
### Notes
========================================================

Within the scope of the first assignment for the "Exploratory Data Analysis" Coursera class the following files have been created and are available in the repo, as described in the assignment's instructions:

* plot1.R, plot1.png: Code file that reads the data from the file and prints histogram of 'Global Active Power' in a png image and the output plot image
        
* plot2.R,plot2.png: Code file that reads the data from the file and prints line graph of 'Global Active Power' in a png image and the output plot image
        
* plot3.R,plot3.png: Code file that reads the data from the file and prints aggregated plots for the Sub metering 1, 2 and 3 and the output plot image
        
* plot4.R,plot4.png: Code file that reads the data from the file and prints a png image of four plots, the ones from Part 2 and Part 3, a line graph for Voltage and a line graph for 'Global reactive power' and the output plot image

**The data**

The data set used is the *"Individual household electric power consumption Data Set"* from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, as specified in the instructions.

**General assumptions**

For this assignment the following assumption were made:
* The data file is located in the current working directory

* Headers are included in the file

* The columns are separated by ';'

* The missing/unknown values are coded as '?'

* The date interval examined is 01-Feb-2007 to 02-Feb-2007

* The plots were directly sent to png graphic device

* The background of the plots is white to ensure compatibility and better readability
